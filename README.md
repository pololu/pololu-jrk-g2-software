# Jrk G2 software

[www.pololu.com](https://www.pololu.com/)

This repository contains the source code of the configuration and control software for
the [Jrk G2 USB Motor Controllers with Feedback][jrk].
There are two programs:
the Pololu Jrk G2 Configuration Utility (jrk2gui)
and the Pololu Jrk G2 Command-line Utility (jrk2cmd).

## Installation

Installers for this software are available for download from the
[Jrk G2 user's guide][guide].

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for information about how to compile the software
from source.

## Version history

- 1.4.1 (2023-07-05):
  - Fixed the feedback wizard so it is readable at 125% DPI on Windows.
    Also improved the size calculations for both wizards and got rid of
    the fixed size, specifying a *minimum* size instead.
- 1.4.0 (2019-03-05):
  - If the product specified in the settings file does not match the Jrk you
    are applying those settings to, the software will now fix the settings to
    have default values for the hard current limit, VIN calibration setting,
    and current calibration settings.  This makes it much easier to create a
    settings file that can work with different Jrk products without
    requiring the user to edit the file.
  - Three new API functions: `jrk_settings_fix_and_change_product`,
    `jrk_settings_set_firmware_version`, and
    `jrk_settings_get_firmware_version`.
  - Switch to a new code/driver signing certificate for Windows.
- 1.3.0 (2018-07-20):
  - Added support for the new Jrk G2 21v3.
  - Added `jrk_reinitialize_and_reset_errors` which behaves like the
    reinitialize command from the original Jrks: it clears all the latched
    errors and sets the "Awaiting command" error if the input mode is serial.
  - Changed `jrk_restore_defaults` to use `jrk_reinitialize_and_reset_errors`
    so that the software still stop the motor when you restore to the
    default settings.
  - Added `--target-relative` option to jrk2cmd.
- 1.2.0 (2018-06-25):
  - Jrk G2 Configuration Utility (jrk2gui):
    - Major changes to the graph window:
      - You can now set the scale and vertical position.
      - Each visible plot now has an arrow indicating its zero position, and
        arrows to indicate if it is overflowing above or below the graph.
      - You can click on a plot or its arrows in order to select it, and then:
        - Use the mouse wheel to zoom that plot in or out, or
        - Use the mouse to drag it up and down.
      - New buttons for resetting the position and scale.
      - You can change plot colors.
      - You can change the graph to use a dark theme.
      - You can save and load graph settings files now.
      - The Y axis is no longer labeled.
      - Fixed a bug that would cause memory leaks while the graph is paused.
    - Change the 'Manually set target box':
      - Made it visible from any tab.
      - Made is use a slider control instead of a scrollbar.
      - Added a "Center" button.
    - Input wizard:
      - Added a "Skip" button to skip the step of learning the neutral point.
      - Changed it to be much more like the feedback wizard.
    - Display the dead zone in the input scaling tab.
    - Added the "Variables" window.
    - Added the "Info" tab and moved some information from the status tab to there.
    - Show two digits after the decimal point for the "Raw current" variable
      in the Status tab and allow its graph to show more resolution as well.
    - Bug fixes:
      - Fix some bugs in the controls for setting the hard current limits and soft
        current limits.
      - Fix a bug where the "Graph" command in the "Window" menu would not succeed
        if the graph was minimized.
      - Fix a bug where the range of the target scroll bar and the corresponding
        number entry would not get updated when you click "Apply settings",
        changing the feedback mode.
      - Fix a bug where the target scroll bar was not being updated when you
        type a target in and press Enter.
      - Fix a bug where you could enter "0" as a deceleration limit (but the GUI
        would warn you and prevent that setting from being applied).
    - Several other minor changes and bug fixes.
  - Jrk G2 Command-line Utility (jrk2cmd):
    - Make the `--run` and `--target` options work together properly.
    - Expand the allowed range of `--speed` arguments to -2048 to 2047, making
      it useful for frequency feedback.
- 1.1.0 (2018-04-25):
  - Added the ability to change the GUI font size using the
    `JRK2GUI_FONT_SIZE` variable.
  - Fixed compilation issues on Ubuntu and macOS.
  - Changed the GUI to use Qt's Fusion theme on non-Windows platforms.
  - Increased the width of the Feedback Wizard.
  - Added scripts to build Linux and macOS installers.
- 1.0.0 (2018-04-20): Original release.
